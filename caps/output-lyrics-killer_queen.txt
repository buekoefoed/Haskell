[VERSE 1]
SHE KEEPS MOÃ«T ET CHANDON
IN HER PRETTY CABINET
"LET THEM EAT CAKE," SHE SAYS
JUST LIKE MARIE ANTOINETTE
A BUILT-IN REMEDY
FOR KHRUSHCHEV AND KENNEDY (OOH, OOH)
AT ANYTIME AN INVITATION
YOU CAN'T DECLINE (OOH, OOH)

CAVIAR AND CIGARETTES
WELL VERSED IN ETIQUETTE
EXTRAORDINARILY NICE

[CHORUS]
SHE'S A KILLER QUEEN
GUNPOWDER, GELATINE
DYNAMITE WITH A LASER BEAM
GUARANTEED TO BLOW YOUR MIND
(PA-PA-PA-PA) ANYTIME
OOH
RECOMMENDED AT THE PRICE
INSATIABLE AN APPETITE
WANNA TRY?

[VERSE 2]
TO AVOID COMPLICATIONS
SHE NEVER KEPT THE SAME ADDRESS
IN CONVERSATION
SHE SPOKE
JUST LIKE A BARONESS
MET A MAN FROM CHINA
WENT DOWN TO GEISHA MINAH (OOH, OOH)
(KILLER, KILLER, SHE'S A KILLER QUEEN)
THEN AGAIN INCIDENTALLY
IF YOU'RE THAT WAY INCLINED

PERFUME CAME NATURALLY
FROM PARIS (NATURALLY)
FOR CARS, SHE COULDN'T CARE LESS
FASTIDIOUS AND PRECISE

[CHORUS]
SHE'S A KILLER QUEEN
GUNPOWDER, GELATIN
DYNAMITE WITH A LASER BEAM
GUARANTEED TO BLOW YOUR MIND
(PA-PA-PA-PA)
ANYTIME

[GUITAR SOLO]

[BRIDGE]
DROP OF A HAT SHE'S AS WILLING AS
PLAYFUL AS A PUSSY CAT
(OOH)
THEN MOMENTARILY OUT OF ACTION (OOH)
TEMPORARILY OUT OF GAS (TA-TAAA)
TO ABSOLUTELY DRIVE YOU WILD, WILD . .
SHE'S ALL OUT TO GET YOU

[CHORUS]
SHE'S A KILLER QUEEN
GUNPOWDER, GELATINE
DYNAMITE WITH A LASER BEAM (PA-PA-PA-RA)
GUARANTEED TO BLOW YOUR MIND
ANYTIME
OOH

RECOMMENDED AT THE PRICE
INSATIABLE AN APPETITE
WANNA TRY?
YOU WANNA TRY . .
